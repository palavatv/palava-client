# palava | client

[palava.tv](https://palava.tv) is a cost-free, simple to use, secure, and open source platform for video calls, built on top of the [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/) technology.

This repository contains the WebRTC client-side library of palava.tv. There is an overview of all parts of palava.tv at [palavatv/palava](https://github.com/palavatv/palava).

## Description

This JavaScript library implements the palava protocol to function together with the [signaltower](https://github.com/palavatv/signaltower/) or the [palava-machine](https://github.com/palavatv/palava-machine) signaling server. It allows you to create PeerConnections to other browser. It includes the [webrtc-adapter](https://github.com/webrtchacks/adapter) project for better WebRTC compatibility.
